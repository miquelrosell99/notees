# Changelog

The record of shipped work for Notees. One entry per shipped slice, newest
first. This file — not `AGENTS.md`, not the runbooks — is where history goes;
those stay static guidance. Before implementing a change, skim this file for
recent related work. Anything before 2026-10-06 lives in git history: the
retired implementation plan and design stack are recoverable from commits
predating this file.

## 2026-10-06

- **chore(docs): milestone markers (M1/M2/M3/M5 labels) scrubbed from code
  comments, test titles, and package docs.** Continuation of the record-keeping
  retirement: `apps/server/src` + `apps/server/test`, `apps/server/Dockerfile`
  ("Notees v2 sync server" → "Notees sync server"), and `packages/{domain,
  store,sync,query,export,protocol}` (incl. `packages/query/README.md`,
  `SCHEMA.md`, `WIRE.md`) no longer name delivery milestones — the text stands
  without the labels ("the M1 default" → "the default", "DEFERRED to M2" →
  "DEFERRED", the M2/M3/M5 describe-blocks in the search suite renamed, …).
  Same deliberate exception as the plan retirement: `packages/protocol/fixtures/`
  stays byte-pinned (the fixture comment strings carrying an M-label are part
  of the sha256-pinned convergence corpus), and live version identifiers
  (envelope v3, `/api/relay/v2`, WS framing v2, `v2.0.0-mN` client tags) are
  untouched — only prose labels went. No logic, symbol, or assertion changes.
- **chore(docs): the plan-as-record workflow retired; `CHANGELOG.md` becomes
  the record.** Deleted `.plans/implementation-plan.md` and `.plans/design/`
  (kept `.plans/2026-10-06-1352-main-content-restructure/` as the first
  date-stamped proposal folder), stripped plan §-citations, `.plans` pointers,
  and v1/v2 history mentions from code comments, tests, and docs. `AGENTS.md`
  is now static guidance with a records index; the `notees-development` and
  `notees-operations` skills point here. Deliberate exception: the protocol
  fixtures under `packages/protocol/fixtures/` keep their metadata untouched —
  those bytes are sha256-pinned across the TS/GTK/Flutter convergence gate.
