# route-reachability.sh — every active-tier file must be ROUTE-reachable.
#
# Complements audit-orphans.sh. audit-orphans checks LINK-reachability: the
# file's path is mentioned *somewhere* (incl. the SKILL.md manifest), so the
# file is not dead. That is necessary but NOT sufficient. This script checks
# ROUTE-reachability: starting from routing.yaml (always_read + every task's
# required_reads + route text) and following hub-navigation edges (a reachable
# file that lists another file's skill-root-relative path), can the agent
# actually arrive at the file while doing a task?
#
# A file that is link-reachable (e.g. listed only in the SKILL.md manifest) but
# on no route is "stored, not activated" — you split it out for cohesion, but
# the task that needs it never reads it. That is pure waste, and the failure
# this check exists to catch.
#
# Active tiers (MUST be route-reachable): architecture/ conventions/ gotchas/
# rules/. Lookup tiers (references/, docs/) are read on demand and exempt;
# workflows/ are routed by each task's `workflow:` field + covered by
# check-cross-references.sh.
#
# The fix for a fine-grained tier is a routed index.md hub: route the hub, list
# each file in it as a skill-root-relative inline-code path; the agent
# navigates from there. One hub keeps a whole tier reachable without enumerating
# every file in every route.
#
# Usage (run from the skill root, the dir holding the tier directories):
#   bash route-reachability.sh
#
# Exit code: 0 = all active-tier files route-reachable, 1 = one or more not.
